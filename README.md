GTM Variable References Chrome Extension

A custom Chrome extension that displays Tag and Trigger references for Google Tag Manager variables directly from the GTM UI.

This tool helps identify where variables are used (tags and triggers) instantly — without clicking into each entity manually.

🚀 Features

✅ Lists User-Defined GTM Variables only

✅ Shows Tags and Triggers that reference each variable

✅ Works inside the GTM interface (no exports required)

✅ Fast, lightweight, and UI-safe (no brittle selectors)

Why This Exists

In complex GTM containers, answering questions like:

“Which tags are using this variable?”

“Is this variable safe to delete?”

“What will break if I change this?”

…normally takes several clicks per variable.

This extension reduces that to one view.
